## tCam Firmware
tCam firmware for gCore is an Espressif IDF project.  You need to have the Espressif v4.4.2 IDF installed to build the firmware.  Pre-compiled binary files are provided (```precompiled``` directory here) and can be programmed using the IDF tools or a Windows utility as described in the ```programming``` directory elsewhere in this repostitory.

### Building
The ```sdkconfig``` file contains ESP32 configuration and build-specific information.  All camera-specific configuration is in the ```main/system_config.h``` file.

To build the project: ```idf.py build```

To load the project onto gCore: 

1. Plug gCore into your computer
2. Turn gCore on
3. ```idf.py -p PORT -b 921600 flash``` where PORT is the name of the serial port associated with gCore.

To monitor diagnostic information from the firmware: ```idf.py -p PORT```.  Output is at 115200 baud.  Note the command will reboot the camera.


### Command Interface
The camera is capable of executing a set of commands and generating responses or sending image and file data when connected to a remote computer.  It can support one remote connection at a time.  Commands and responses are encoded as json-structured strings.  The command interface exists as a TCP/IP socket at port 5001 when using WiFi.

Each json command or response is delimited by two characters.  A Start delimiter (8-bit value 0x02) precedes the json string.  An End delimiter (8-bit value 0x03) follows the json string.  The json string may be tightly packed or may contain white space.

```<0x02><json string><0x03>```

The camera currently supports the following commands.  They are a superset of the commands supported by tCam-Mini.  tCam-specific commands are noted with an asterisk (*).  The communicating application should wait for a response from commands that generate one before issuing subsequent commands (although the camera command buffer is 12,288 bytes (sized for the ```fw_segment``` command) and can support multiple short commands).

Column c1 should be less than or equal to c2.  Row r1 should be less than or equal to r2.  All four argument values must be specified.  They specify the box of pixels the Lepton uses to calculate the spotmeter temperature (which is contained in the image telemetry).

#### stream_on
```
{
	"cmd":"stream_on",
	"args":{
		"delay_msec":0,
		"num_frames":0
	}
}
```

| stream\_on argument | Description |

| sta_ssid | The SSID used when the camera's WiFi is configured as a client (STAtion mode) |
| flags | 8-bit Wifi Status as a decimal number (see below). |
| ap\_ip_addr | The camera's IP address when it is in AP mode. |
| sta\_ip_addr | The static IP address to use when the camera is a client and configured to use a static IP. |
| sta_netmask | The netmask to use when the camera is a client and configured to use a static IP. |
| cur\_ip_addr | The camera's current IP address.  This may be a DHCP served address if the camera is configured in Client mode with static IP addresses disabled. |

Password information is not sent as part of the wifi response.

| Flag Bit | Description |
| --- | --- |

| 3 | Bit 3: Wifi Connected - Set to 1 when connected to another device. |
| 2 | Wifi Client Running - Set to 1 when the client has been started, 0 when disabled (obviously this bit will never be 0). |
| 1 | Wifi Initialized - Set to 1 when the WiFi subsystem has been successfully initialized (obviously this bit will never be 0). |
| 0 | Bit 0: Wifi Enabled - Set to 1 when Wifi has been enabled, 0 when Wifi has been disabled. |

#### set_wifi
```
{
  "cmd": "set_wifi",
  "args": {
    "ap_ssid": "ANewApName",
    "ap_pw: "apassword",
    "ap_ip_addr": "192.168.4.1",
    "flags": 145,

    "sta_ip_addr": "10.0.1.144",
    "sta_netmask": "255.255.255.0"
  }
}
```

Individual args values may be left out (for example to just set AP or Client (STA) values.  The camera will use the existing value.

| set_wifi argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ap_ssid | Set the AP-mode SSID and also the camera name as reported in the metadata and status objects (1-32 characters). |
| ap_pw | Set the AP-mode password (8-63 characters). |
| ap\_ip_addr | The camera's IP address when it is in AP mode. |
| flags | Set WiFi configuration (see below). |
| sta_ssid | Set the client-mode (STA) SSID (1-32 characters). |
| sta_pw | Set the client-mode (STA) password (8-63 characters). |
| sta\_ip_addr | Set the static IP address to use when the camera as a client and configured to use a static IP. |
| sta_netmask | Set the netmask to use when the camera as a client and configured to use a static IP. |

Only a subset of the flags argument are used to configure WiFi operation.  Other bit positions are ignored.

| Flag Bit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | Client Mode - Set to 1 for Client mode, 0 for AP mode. |
| 4 | Static IP - Set to 1 to use a Static IP, 0 to request an IP via DHCP when operating in Client mode. |
| 0 | Bit 0: Wifi Enabled - Set to 1 to enable Wifi, 0 to disable Wifi. |

The command will fail if an SSID is zero length or greater than 32 characters or if a password is less than 8 characters or greater than 63 characters.

Although I do not recommend it, use the following procedure to set a zero-length (null) password.

1. Reset the Wifi configuration using the Wifi reset button.  This sets all password fields to a null value.
2. Use the Desktop application to configure the Wifi but make sure the password field is not updated (de-select the Update checkbox).  Alternatively send a set_wifi command without a password (```ap_pw``` or ```sta_pw``` argument).

#### get\_filesystem_list
Command to get the directories at the root of the filesystem:

```
{
	"cmd": "get_filesystem_list",
	"args": {
		"dir_name":"/"
	}
}
```
Command to get the files in a specific directory.

```
{
	"cmd": "get_filesystem_list",
	"args": {
		"dir_name": "tcam_22_11_05"
	}
}
```

The ```get_filesystem_list``` command is used to return a list of the top level directories or the files within one of those directories in the ```filesystem_list``` response.  Typically the individual entries in the list of top level directories are used in subsequent commands to get a list of all files in the filesystem.

#### filesystem_list response
Response containing list of directories at the root of the filesystem.

```
{
	"filesystem_list": {
		"dir_name":"/",
		"name_list":"tcam_00_01_01,tcam_21_04_02,tcam_22_10_30,tcam_22_10_31,tcam_22_11_02,tcam_22_11_05,"
	}
}
```

Response containing a list of files within a specific directory.

```
{
	"filesystem_list": {
		"dir_name": "tcam_22_11_05",
		"name_list": "img_13_33_40.tjsn,mov_13_33_47.tmjsn,"
	}
}
```

	"args" {
		"dir_name": "tcam_22_11_05",
		"file_name": "mov_13_33_47.tmjsn"
	}
}
```

| get\_file argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| dir_name | Directory name containing file. |
| file_name | File in the specified directory to get. |

The ```get_file``` command returns a ```cam_info``` response containing failure information if the file cannot be found.  It returns one or more ```image``` responses and optionally a ```video_info``` response if the file is present.

An image file will return a single ```image``` response with the contents of the image file.

A video file will return a series of ```image``` responses, one for each image in the video, followed by a ```video_info``` response (which is the final component in a tmjsn video file).

Please see the description of the tmjsn file format in the Desktop Application directory readme.  To reconstruct a tmjsn file from the responses to a ```get_file``` command append the END\_OF_JSON delimiter (0x03) after each ```image``` json string.

#### video_info response

```
{
	"video_info": {
		"end_date":"11/5/22",
		"end_time":"13:33:50.438",
		"num_frames":25,
		"start_date":"11/5/22",
		"start_time":"13:33:47.638",
		"version":1
	}
}
```

The "video_info" json text string contains the starting and ending timestamps and number of frames. It is used by applications to validate the file and also determine if it should show the "Fast Forward" control for videos with long delays between frames.

#### delete\_filsystem_obj

```
{
	"cmd": "delete_filesystem_obj",
	"args": {
		"dir_name":"tcam_22_11_05",

	}
}
```

| delete\_filsystem_obj argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| dir_name | Directory name containing file. |
| file_name | File in the specified directory to delete. |

Returns a ```cam_info``` message indicating success or failure if there is no file.

#### poweroff
```{"cmd": "poweroff"}```

There is no response as the camera powers off immediately after receiving the command.

#### cam_info messages
The ```cam_info``` response is generated for commands that do not return a response such as ```set_clock```, ```set_config``` or ```set_wifi``` with status about the success or failure of the command.  It can also be generated by the camera for certain errors.

For example, ```cam_info``` for ```set_clock``` looks like.

```
{
  "cam_info": {
    "info_value": 1,
    "info_string": "set_clock success"
  }
}
```

| cam_info Item | Description |

| start | Starting byte of current chunk. |
| length | Length of chunk in bytes. |
| data | Base64 encoded binary data chunk. |

#### dump_screen

```{"cmd": "dump_screen"}```

A ```cam_info``` message indicating unsupported command will be sent in response if support for this command has not been compiled into the binary.  Otherwise a series of ```screen_dump_response``` responses will be sent.

#### screen\_dump_response response

```
{
	"screen_dump_response": {
		"start": 0,
		"length": 16384,
		"data": "I3Ypdg12B3YPdgt2BXYRdgF2A3YFdgF2AXYNdv91+3ULdvd..."
	}
}
```

| Response | Description |
| --- | --- |
| start | Starting byte location for this segment of the image. |
| length | Number of bytes in this segment. |
| data | Base64 encoded segment data.  Data is 16-bit RGB565 pixel data encoded in Big Endian format for the tCam 480x320 pixel display. |

Currently the firmware sends up to 16,384 bytes at a time for the 307,200 byte display frame buffer (480 x 320 x 2 bytes/pixel) requiring 19 ```screen_dump_response``` packets (the final packet contains only 12,288 bytes).  The frame buffer is organized with the upper-left corner the pixel position (0, 0) and first pixel sent, row by row.

### OTA FW Update Process
The OTA FW update process consists of several steps.  The FW is contained in the binary file ```tCamMini.bin``` in the precompiled FW directory or built using the Espressif IDF.  No other binary files are required.

1. An external computer initiates the update process by sending a ```fw_update_request```.
2. The camera starts blinking the LED in an alternating red/green pattern to indicate a FW update has been requested.  The user must press the Wifi Reset Button to confirm the update should proceed.
3. The camera sends a ```get_fw``` to request a chunk of data from the computer.
4. The computer sends a ```fw_segment``` with the requested data.
5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until the entire firmware binary file has been transferred.
6. The camera validates the binary file and sends a ```cam\_info``` indicating if the update is successful or has failed.  If successful the camera then reboots into the new firmware.

#### Using telemetry data

The Status AGC State bit indicates the form of the pixel data.  When AGC is enabled the lepton performs a histogram analysis of the data and the pixel data is 8-bits (low byte of each 16-bit word) designed to directly index a palette array for display.  When AGC is disabled the lepton outputs 16-bit radiometric data in each pixel.  This data represents the actual temperature of each pixel in degrees Kelvin scaled by either 10 (TLinear Resolution Flag = 0) or 100 (TLinear Resolution Flag = 1).  The TLinear Resolution Flag indicates the gain mode of the Lepton (0 = Low Gain, 1 = High Gain).

The radiometric pixel temperature in °C may be computed using the following formula where TLinear resolution is 0.1 if TLinear Resolution Flag is 0 and 0.01 if TLinear Resolution Flag is 1.

``` TempC = Pixel[15:0] * TLinear_resolution - 273.15```

The Spot Meter average temperature value is computed using the same formula, substituting the Spot Meter Mean for pixel data, and is valid independent of AGC enabled or disabled.  The Spot Meter is the average value of the pixels in the box defined by the Spot Meter (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) coordinates.

The FFC State may be used to identify when the lepton is preparing to perform a FFC (flat field correction) and is performing a FFC.  While performing a FFC the lepton closes the shutter in front of the sensor array.  Image data is not available while a FFC is being performed.
